## Project Working Title
<i>Safeguarding Virtual Machines during Scammer Takedowns: Modelling an Authorized Remote Desktop Application RAT Malware with Wireshark-based IP Identification</i>

## Project Contributors
* Ryan I. 
* Jarrad M. (Project Supervisor)

## Project Outline
This project aims to investigate and develop effective measures to enhance virtual machine (VM) security by manipulating the IP address in a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) during scammer
takedown operations. 

In this context, the victim (Client) voluntarily grants the scammer (Server) access to their machine, while a victim-controlled RAT is covertly deployed. The active
participation of the victim enables them to modify the RAT’s IP address to match that of the scammer, facilitating the identification and subsequent takedown of the scammer. 

Additionally, this research project will explore the methodologies employed by popular YouTuber and Software Engineer, Jim Browning, who specialises in scammer takedowns using manipulation
and social engineering attacks, including spoofing techniques by posing as someone who understand little about IT to get the scammer to download their files. The project aims to evaluate
Browning’s techniques and gain a deeper understanding of how they can be applied to enhance scammer takedown operations and overall VM security.
